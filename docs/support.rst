artman is currently tested with Python 2.7, Python 3.4, Python 3.5,

.. note::

    The authors of this documentation are humans, and this is an exceptionally
    easy spot to end up out of date.

    Our ``nox.py`` and ``.circleci/config.yml`` files are the real source
    of truth for what versions of Python we test against.
